/*Compare the Java and Scala programming languages
Java supports incremental and decremental operators but Scala doesnâ€™t support incremental or decremental operators.  
Using incremental or decremental operators will change the value of the variable. 
Therefore, incremental and decremental operators cannot be used for immutable types. 
For example, in Scala those operators cannot be used for data with Val declaration. 
As it will be a confusion incremental and decremental operators are removed from Scala.*/
